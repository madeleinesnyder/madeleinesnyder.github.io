							<div class="divScroll"> <p>The Hatter's Chicken</p>
	<p class="tab"> The parochial chicken sat down with a thump. The teacups rattled and sugar cubes tumbled down from their pyramidal construction. The hatter paused, mid-sip, and red hibiscus tea spilled down onto his yellow cravat.  
	“Well there’s no need to get all huffy and ruffled over a game of Foce,” the hatter grimaced and set down his cup. Looking down at his ruined finery, his face contorted further. “And see what you’ve done to my primary colors, you’ve gone and muddled them up with the secondaries. How rude.” The chicken made no move to mollify the Hatter and sat, feet stuck out in the most inelegant manner possible like two sticks protruding from a poorly built snowman, with its wings folded voluptuously across its breast and its beak twisted into a frown. </p>
	<p class="tab">“Well shall we bring out the cakes?” Piped a voice from the other end of the table. The Hatter looked up with a start and blinked, as if suddenly aware that he was in fact, alive, and surrounded by other living things. 
	“Ah yes of course! And don’t forget the powdered sugar, it’s good for the digestion,” he smiled half-heartedly and knit his eyebrows together, attention turning back to his teacup and then to his cravat. A light creak came from the head of the table and a pattering of feet followed quickly. Then moments later a black crow emerged from the treetops, issuing a disgusting caw. 
	“Well no need to bring the pomp and circumstance, that call is such an earworm, please keep your crowings to yourself,” sniffed the Hatter as he peered up into the sky, one hand shielding his eyes from the sun, although six wide brimmed hats already created a disk of shade wider than his arm span. The crow crawed louder, as if in jest, and unceremoniously dropped a package of qhite paper on the table. It slid, pushing aside cups and ceramic jars of cream and plates of scones and pots of jam and butter until it came to an unnaturally precise halt at the Hatter’s fingertips. He unwound a thread from around the package and whisked it off like a magician removes a cloth from a conjured bird. </p>
	<p class="tab"> “Voila! Cake! Are you pleased, chicken?” The chicken simply scowled. But a small drop of drool glistened at its beak. 
	“While I’m not apt to drowning my furies in worldly indulgances, I suppose one slice wouldn’t hurt,” the chicken uncrossed its wings and scooted closer to the table like a fat man at a buffet, flailing its twiggy legs to and fro to hop the chair towards the plate and utensils. The Hatter brandished a massive carving knife, suitable for perhaps a leg of lamb or a suckling pig, and made a surgically precise incision into the center of the cake. White syrup gushed out through the cracks of the slice and spilled over onto the tablecloth. </p>
	<p class="tab">“Ah I see it’s a leaking cake, most good for the digestion,” the chicken licked its beak and inhaled the fumes of broken crust through its nose holes. Its eyes rolled back and the Hatter paused, mid cut, slowly drawing the knife to a napkin trailing a gelatinous and intestinal string of white goo along with it. He slid the knife along the white cloth, failing entirely to clean the metal and instead covered the napkin with a mucous of white sugar. He grinned wickedly,
	“Well I know you haven’t eaten for days, and the urge to rush must be utterly overwhelming.” The chicken seized up, fighting down a frustration roiling up from, not its belly, but a more primal, urging part of its brain. The part that saws kill him now and eat the cake. </p>
	<p class="tab">“I don't quite know what you mean,” it turned away, keeping the cake just in sight, watching the Hatter poised with a plate and the enslimed napkin. The Hatter lifted the cake from the plate, dripping white, and slapped it onto the plate. The chicken swallowed. 
	“Well, then I’m sure you wouldn’t mind if we walked another bound around Wonderland and then ate,” he smirked and furiously smashed the plate onto the table, cake down. It collapsed under the porcelain and oozed out onto the table. “And now it’s gone and ruined my finery, I’ll have to clean that up.” The Hatter picked up a water jug like a toddler grabbed at a sippy cup and doused the entire cake and the squashed piece. Soggy crumbs ran all over the floor and through the drains positioned conveniently at each table leg. The chicken let out a strangled gasp and felt rage licking up from its stomach. 
	“What you monster?” It shrieked, flapping its wings and producing a cloud of feathers and dandruff.
	“Now now, calm your cravings, we wouldn’t want you to lose control, now would we? </p><p class="tab">There’s only enough room for one kind of insanity here.” The Hatter smiled furiously, baring all forty-four teeth and the red veins near the backs of his eyes.</p>
	<p> </p>

<p> The Automaton </p>
	<p class="tab">Well, I suppose now is as good a time as any to start. </p>
<p class="tab">The advantage of being an automaton is that I never run out of steam. My enthusiasm never flags, my productivity never dips, and my motivation never wavers. The problem is that I cannot wind myself up. So I sit, collecting dust and dead fruit flies until some pair of little (or, preferably, world-worn and caring) hands scoops me up in a cloud of debris and winds the key at the small of my back. </p>
<p class="tab">Then I spring to life. My gears begin to turn, my joints creak and plead for oil, my eyes flicker open (not that I can see, in the human sense), and my posture straightens out like a schoolboy stung by a wasp. I snap both hands together and lift the pen that has (presumably) been placed between my left forefinger and thumb. Then I draw. I draw whatever pops into my mind; valleys, mountains, houses, television remotes, novelty porcelain salt shakers that look like squirrels, armchairs, bags of potatoes, those funny poodle-curl carpet wigs that members of Parliament still wear despite the fact that it’s 2055. It all flows out, and the winder watches spellbound, mouth agog, usually pointing and attempting to utter some adequate expression of wonder and awe. </p>
<p class="tab">I simply keep drawing. Then as more gather around the table where I sit, industrious and furiously scribbling, I notice the lines coming more slowly, the ink beginning to blot in frustratingly irregular patterns, the paper occasionally crinkling up like it smelled something bad. And then I stop. I don’t know how or when exactly it happens, but just at some moment I know I am still, and I had previously been moving. At this point a sigh of contentment usually rises, and I’m put back onto the shelf, wrapped in my smothering cocoon of metal and dead insects, waiting.</p>

<p> Broccoli. An Ode. </p>

<p class="tab">How green. How filling. How utterly diverse in its uses. Such grace, such beauty, such lush green organic splendor. Such garbage.</p>

<p class="tab">I swear if I have to eat another stalk of broccoli I am going to throw up all over this Venetian shag rug. Didn’t know there was such thing as a Venetian shag rug did you now? Well there is, and I’m sitting on it in my dirty old tennis shoes and salt-spray shorts, marring and tangling the immaculately combed threads and mussing the general Feng Shui of the room. I inspect my reflection briefly in my black, mirror-like newly varnished nails and sigh. My nose is still enormous, and my sad lack of accomplishments make it a mark of ineptitude and an excuse for societal banishment rather than a quirky idiosyncrasy. Maybe I’d grow into it. Or maybe it keeps growing, gradually dwarfing the rest of my delicate face and confining me to the corners of the world reserved for lepers, pedophiles, and socially inept and unhygienic computer programmers.</p>

<p class="tab">The bowl of broccoli sat on the rug, emitting fumes comparable to coal refineries and milk pasteurizing factories. I gagged and picked up my chopsticks, shoveling in another unruly miniature tree with the hopes that the infectious beast within me would starve and die within the next week or so. Bro, Cali. Maybe that’s the true etymology: it is eaten by bros all over the world who want to gain enough gain muscle and lose enough fat to resemble neurotic racehorses and Upper East Side greyhounds. It is consumed as a staple by movie stars with enough mental energy and private security to bitch-slap any remotely caloric or sugary food from their girlfriends’ mouths as soon as the #loveyourself #indulge Instagram photo has been snapped, posted, and showered with adulation and the elusive eleventh “like”. And then it is consumed by me: a lowly, traveling, resting and undisciplined faker of joy, who sits in the dark, alone, eating broccoli.</p>

<p class="tab">I threw up. Green paste curdled in little inlets, soaking into the fibrous mat underneath the carpet, coating every last Venetian thread like a helicopter-load of DDT showered down onto 1950 suburbian lawns. Shit. I grabbed a paper towel from the role a few feet away and mashed it down into the carpet. It was futile. The stain would stick and the stench would linger. If the owner did nothing people would smell it for decades. Couples back from a night of drinking would return to the room, rush to tear each others’ clothes off and tumble onto the rug with unbridled passion, only to pause, mid-romp, and respectively dry up and deflate at the faint smell of broccoli vomit. Noses wrinkled, staring awkwardly at each others’ unflattering expressions, stuck in the most naked and ungainly of positions, they realize love involves gross, moist, squelching of less than beautiful body parts. Then promptly the flame is extinguished and they skulk off to their respective corners of the room or perhaps back down to the bar to consider if the sight of the other hunched over a toilet, spewing vomit or something more vile is too much strain for their current relationship. As they sit confined in the bathroom with the tap running or alone outside sipping an over-priced gin and tonic they wonder if marriage would end with a messy divorce and an inability to take a shit or vomit for the rest of their miserable lives.</p>

<p class="tab">So this is my mark on the world. A lingering, Venetian-rug-marring, marriage-saving broccoli stain. Produced from the very essence of my being: my idiotic, unreceptive, offensive, and entirely unoriginal brain, and noxious, eyebrow-curling acidic stomach juices. </p>

<p>Formal</p>

<p class="tab">England is so green. It’s like it’s always spring, but just happens to be unseasonably cold for the majority of the time. Formal was a night of debauchery and old-fashioned University student mischief. We milled about outside the doors of the great hall; Jamie was pacing back and forth like a nervous deacon with his black dining gown whipping back and forth. </p>
<p class="tab"> “Where in God’s name have they gone off to?” he seethed. I watching, smirking, and wondered if he was actually the nervous Nellie of the group, despite his nonchalant attitude if asked about anything remotely serious. Two girls tottering in heels with flying capes rounded the corner, chattering and giggling. Jamie fumed toward them, “all the good seats will be gone!” </p>
<p class="tab"> “Oh pipe down Jamie,” one said. “There’s no high table tonight so there’ll be plenty of room”. The other flung a lock of perfectly coiffed bleach blonde hair over her gown and said, “Oh he’s just worried about the seating plan for pass the mint”. Both girls imploded in a fit of mocking laughter and Jamie spun on his heel to go into the hall. </p>
<p class="tab"> “Fat lot of help you two are”, he grumbled, and went up to the porter to point to his name on the list. Frederick William James Richards III. “Yes that’s me”. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Right, in you go. And who is this?” The porter asked, raising an eyebrow at my conspicuously ungowned goosedown jacket ensemble. </p>
<p class="tab"> “Oh, she’s my American guest, sorry, the name should be just below”. He poked at the paper. Alicia Smith Jackson. Decidedly un-British and not nearly pretentious enough to fit in. We entered the hall and sat down on a long wooden bench at a table that appeared to be structurally quite precarious—it looked fine from a distance but upon closer inspection it was just a block of well-polished wood sitting on wide-based table legs. Nothing but the weight of the board and the limited jostling of students to keep the tabletop from slipping off and depositing the meal, the wine, and everyone’s dignity into gowned laps and onto freshly-shined shoes. 
<p class="tab">The rest of the group poured in, every other student carrying a bottle of some outrageously cheap wine that becomes drinkable only after the fourth glass. Jamie snatched a box of wine from the hand of a student with plastered black hair and grinned,
	“Oh Ivan thanks for the wine”. Ivan spun around, </p>
<p class="tab">“If you think I’m not sitting with you and drinking exactly half of that then you’re mad”. He plopped down on the bench next to me and pinned up his robe sleeves and flattened his already rather planar hair. An American sandwich. How unappealingly bland. I introduced myself with an overenthusiastically American grin and we turned back to the table to start the job of getting properly drunk before the soup course.  </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Bring out the soup!” A bell clanged in the kitchen and maids wearing black dresses and linen doily aprons rushed out with luminous tureens precariously full with carrot ginger soup. Bowls were handed round and I froze, confronted with a platoon of polished silver—a general spoon, a colonel spoon, and three riflemen spoons lined up side by side. Dear God, which fucking spoon do I use? The other all picked up the same, seemingly arbitrarily chosen rifleman #2 spoon despite having finished nearly half a bottle of wine each. I picked up the spoon everyone else had used and made a mental note to not refill my wine glass until I was absolutely sure I couldn’t fuck up some essential piece of etiquette that would label me as a barbaric New Worlder Yank. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “—And then he just tossed the duck out the window!” Roars of laughter came from the table just next to us and someone began to pound on the table.   </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Prayer!” rumbled an old, rather stout Englishman at the front of the room. The tables fell into a surprisingly respectful silence and everyone set down their spoons as a tiny, somewhat undernourished blonde third year walked to the front of the hall and recited a Latin prayer. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Amen”, the room echoed. Then the clanging of spoons commenced and the laughter bubbled up again from the table discussing the defenestration of ducks. The soup was rather good, though the main perk was it was warm and provided some shield against the bitter cold pouring into the hall. For some reason the doors had been left open, and I was shaking in my Oxford patent leather shoes. Ivan eyed my wine glass. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Not a drinker eh?” he said mockingly, and slugged a very unladylike volume of vinegary three euro red wine into my glass. I laughed and took a sip. Please don’t be very alcoholic. Please let me retain some shred of ability to follow these confounding rules. The bell clanged again and the servers swarmed, clearing dishes, stacking one on top of the other and replacing each dish with a piping hot steak covered in some mysterious brown sauce. Worcester? Heinz? Chocolate? God knows. Silver trays the size of small Labradors were deposited at the ends of the table, and Jamie began to wave for everyone to pass their plates forward for the veg. He mounded potatoes and cabbage and somewhat wilty cauliflower onto each plate and slid them back down the table. And then poked his head up like someone in a P.G. Wodehouse sketch and slid his plate onto the bench hidden by the table. A server deposited another plate of steak in front of him and he grinned at Ivan. Dumping the second steak on top of the first like a stack of bovine pancakes he proceeded to eat with relish. I stared down at my molded risotto and fried potatoes and practiced internally my British curse words. Bloody forks, which wanking knife do I use? Pieces of shite. I picked up the outermost fork and stabbed at a potato. It was alarmingly resilient and spun out like a car on an icy road, flipping off my plate into the lap of a rather chubby and clown-featured boy across the table who was stuffing a monstrously large piece of cauliflower into his mouth. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Oh, I’m so sorry!” I reached over in what was supposed to be a gesture of tidying, and knocked over my swollenly full wine glass. Red everywhere. I murdered my chances at conforming to old British etiquette and the evidence dripped down the table in a blood red stain that soaked into the white dessert napkins folded like tricorn hats at the top of the place settings. I could have died. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “We’ve got a spiller!” The clown-face boy hollered and pounded the table, looking at me not with disdain or disgust, but genuine amusement. He thrust the bottle of wine into my face, “alrightly then drink it!” Jamie turned to me and snickered, </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Nice going, you’ve spilt all your wine, now you’ve got to down the rest of the bottle!” I was somewhat relieved that this was an acceptable error, but also horrified at the three solid inches of disgustingly pungent drugstore wine sloshing around in the bottle clenched in clown-boy’s fist. I took the bottle, </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Well, I’m getting very drunk tonight”, and began to drink. Jamie threw his head back and hooted as my pace of drinking slowed. Finally, with my head spinning and taste buds thoroughly bludgeoned, I set down the empty bottle. Ivan slapped me on the back and proceeded to munch through his steak and potatoes. I sat there, stunned. I just drank a half bottle of wine in one go. I’m going to die.
“—appy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday dear Geooooorge! Happy Birthday to you!” The table behind us chorused drunkenly and a lanky boy (I presume George), rose to his feet on one of the benches. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Thank you, thank you! Tonight we celebrate, my birthday. It’s a special one—the seventh of this month!” The entirely table was a mash of fists banging and unintelligible female shrieks and male booms of “well done mate!” He tottered for a bit, then sat back down, gown disheveled and grinning so wide I thought his face might crack in two. By this time my head was swimming, and clown-boy’s features were starting to look a bit like Mr. Potato head stick on pieces.  The bell sounded a third time, and our plates were whisked away and replaced with smaller plates of some kind of fruity crumble. A rather large boy at the end pounded the table, </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Where’s the bloody custard? We can’t have crumble without the bloody custard?” Everyone around him laughed and dug into their desserts, leaving him fuming at the lack of extra dessert that was apparently a grand injustice on the part of the dining staff. 
“He is kind of right, plain crumble is a bit rubbish”, Jamie said, poking at the crust with his dessertspoon. Ivan’s hand flashed across my place setting and deposited what I think was a 5 pence piece straight into the middle of Jamie’s dish.  </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Eh maybe eating it with your face will be more amusing huh Jamie?” he laughed. Jamie glared at him and the girl sitting across from us whipped out her smartphone to record the upcoming humiliation. </p> 
<p class="tab">“You’ve got to Jamie!” people yelled from down the table. Reluctantly, he bent towards the dish, hands behind back, and stuck his tongue into the crust in a pathetic attempt to break the industrially baked surface of the crumble. The girl reached out and gave his head a little shove down into the dish, </p> 
<p class="tab">“You’ve got to be more aggressive with your tongue if you want to get anywhere”, she smirked and the boys around her roared with laughter.  </p> 
<p class="tab">“Yeah Jamie, don’t be so delicate”, chimed in a second. And pretty soon the conversation devolved into a series of jeering remarks about the number of Newtons of force Jamie’s tongue was capable of applying.  </p> 
<p class="tab"> “All right all right just let me eat my damn dessert you wankers!” Jamie huffed and went back to nibbling away. I inspected what must be left of the meal. But when I looked down my dessert was gone. Clown-boy had slid it over to his side of the table and had proceed to gobble it and wipe the dish unusually clean.</p> 
<p class="tab">“And now, we nick the dish. This one’s nice, it’s got a crest.” He put his thumb under the gold emblem of a dragon on the rim. I opened my mouth and then closed it again and then opened it again, </p> 
<p class="tab">“What do you mean, nick the dish? It’s their dish!” I was somewhat shocked—apparently stealing dishes is routine and traditional debauchery.  He slipped the dish somewhere into the ample folds of his dining gown and grinned, pushing a saucer into my place setting so as not to arouse the suspicion of the maids. Coffeepots materialized at the ends of the tables and everyone began to fill their cups with caffeine to offset the alcohol already fully homogenized into the bloodstream. I didn’t dare touch caffeine—I would be up and unwieldy and not any more sober. In fact, I kept getting drunker as more of the wine seeped into my bloodstream. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “Pass the mint!” someone hollered at the end of our table. There was a mass of scrambling as students began turning towards their neighbor, poking their faces together—no, kissing—no smashing chins—no, wait what? I was utterly bewildered, realizing I was caught in a fireman’s brigade of passing a gold-wrapped after dinner mint mouth to mouth along each bench. Ivan turned to me hurriedly, frantically gesturing for me to lean in and the mint and waving his arms at the other side of the table, which, I later learned we were racing. I smushed my mouth against his, grabbing the mint astoundingly ungracefully and whipped my head around to—shit—Jamie. My cheeks flushed crimson and I realized the utter dire importance of seating during formal. Jamie leaned in and gave me the most practical and hurried kiss I had ever received, biting down on the chocolate and then tearing away to hand it off down the line. 
“What on earth was that?” I laughed, and Ivan explained ‘Pass the Mint’. I sat, stunned, and thought why dear God why don’t we have formal at Harvard. Then, suddenly remembering the religious overtones of the meal, gave post hoc thanks to whatever deity allowed me to be seated between Ivan and Jamie, and not clown-boy and angry custard boy. The bell clanged for the last time and people pushed back from their benches, staggering and laughing and walking out still holding their wine glasses. I got up and saw sparkles bursting all over my field if vision and sat back down. </p> 
<p class="tab"> “A bit much?” Jamie smirked.  </p> 
<p class="tab"> “You have no idea” I lisped, and gripped the table, bracing myself to rise at a more reasonable pace.  </p>

<p class="tab">The aboriginal tinkle of manufactured ice cubes in the steel bottle gives way to a gurgling pour. The empty space in the cup is replaced by full empty space, and a second, distorted and rococo chandelier materializes on the surface of the water. </p>

<p class="tab">I hold the cup to my lips and relish the gentle cloud of heat-absorbing vapor that hangs above the surface of the liquid. It creeps up my lip to my septum and pricks my most unruly nose hairs. </p>

<p class="tab"> Then, with full anticipation, I tilt the cup and the shock of the energy drain begins. The heat is sucked from the intelligent focal point of my cupid’s bow, then the delicate roots of my four front teeth, then the basin in the middle of my tongue. My palette instinctively clamps down on the fluid, squishing the pool of water accumulated on my most central taste buds to the nubile and feathery insides of my cheeks. My throat expands, lifting the sniveling uvula out of harm’s way and producing a cavern that is larger than the Grand Canyon in my mind’s eye. Then the liquid rushes down, vacuumed to the back of my throat and rolled into the tubes of my digestive system. A ball of ice forms in my chest and travels down. Hitting the top of the stomach and shocking the sphincter that can’t help but say ok go right ahead no need to wait the stomach will be with you soon. </p>

<p class="tab">I set the cup on the wooden table with a soft tap and wonder why I think picking up the glass and putting it down are any different. </p>

<p> Short Skirts </p>

<p class="tab"> We wear short skirts because we cannot talk. </p>
<p class="tab"> We paint our lips red because we are mute.</p>
<p class="tab"> We tie up our hair because we are gagged and bound.</p>

<p class="tab"> We seek eyes and reactions, </p>
<p class="tab"> Not flagrant advances and sexual expectations.</p>

<p class="tab"> Loneliness is the universal human disease. If no one reacts to your presence you begin to vanish. You shrink. You blend. You meld with the crowd. People jostle you more and more each day, bumping into you like temporary plastic restaurant sign. Your senses flood, jumping and darting, existing as a sponge and a purely sensory organ. All in, nothing out.</p>

<p class="tab"> So you begin to speak, but no one listens. You yell, you shriek, you roll your eyes, you jab your elbows, you cry out “Mierda, ten cuidado!” but you are ignored. </p>

<p class="tab"> So you begin to dress in high skirts and low tops. The men turn. They watch you. The curve of your hip, the arc of your thigh, the swish of your hem, the luxurious dip of your neckline. You begin to wear makeup. The women turn. They watch you. The creamy red of your lips, the dashing blue of your lids, the alien shimmer of your brow and the perfect crescent of your eyeline. You begin to strap on heels and delicate jewelry. The predators turn. They watch you. The felled animal strain of your calves, the bombastic pendulum swing of your earrings, the hypnotic shimmer and jangle of your bracelets and rings. </p>

<p class="tab"> And so you are seen again. People move aside. People hear you when you cry out “Mi collar!” Those who are gallant come to your aid when your feet can’t take the weight of your jewels and you skin turns pimply from cold. </p>

<p class="tab"> But you are not content. People see and people respond, but people do not listen. </p>

<p class="tab"> You entice men and women to cafes and bars. You feed them drink. You tell them stories. They assume, and they comply. They bring you home and you shed your jewels and sparse clothing like the skin of a snake and lie with them, sweating, hoping some semblance of communication has passed through your skin and infected them. But none has. </p>

<p class="tab"> Still no one listens. Everyone sees, everyone hears, every moves and response. But nobody listens. </p>
