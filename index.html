							<h2>Short Stories</h2>
							<div class="divScroll"> <p>The Hatter's Chicken<p class="tab">
	The parochial chicken sat down with a thump. The teacups rattled and sugar cubes tumbled down from their pyramidal construction. The hatter paused, mid-sip, and red hibiscus tea spilled down onto his yellow cravat.  
	“Well there’s no need to get all huffy and ruffled over a game of Foce,” the hatter grimaced and set down his cup. Looking down at his ruined finery, his face contorted further. “And see what you’ve done to my primary colors, you’ve gone and muddled them up with the secondaries. How rude.” The chicken made no move to mollify the Hatter and sat, feet stuck out in the most inelegant manner possible like two sticks protruding from a poorly built snowman, with its wings folded voluptuously across its breast and its beak twisted into a frown. </p>
	<p class="tab">“Well shall we bring out the cakes?” Piped a voice from the other end of the table. The Hatter looked up with a start and blinked, as if suddenly aware that he was in fact, alive, and surrounded by other living things. 
	“Ah yes of course! And don’t forget the powdered sugar, it’s good for the digestion,” he smiled half-heartedly and knit his eyebrows together, attention turning back to his teacup and then to his cravat. A light creak came from the head of the table and a pattering of feet followed quickly. Then moments later a black crow emerged from the treetops, issuing a disgusting caw. 
	“Well no need to bring the pomp and circumstance, that call is such an earworm, please keep your crowings to yourself,” sniffed the Hatter as he peered up into the sky, one hand shielding his eyes from the sun, although six wide brimmed hats already created a disk of shade wider than his arm span. The crow crawed louder, as if in jest, and unceremoniously dropped a package of qhite paper on the table. It slid, pushing aside cups and ceramic jars of cream and plates of scones and pots of jam and butter until it came to an unnaturally precise halt at the Hatter’s fingertips. He unwound a thread from around the package and whisked it off like a magician removes a cloth from a conjured bird. </p>
	<p class="tab"> “Voila! Cake! Are you pleased, chicken?” The chicken simply scowled. But a small drop of drool glistened at its beak. 
	“While I’m not apt to drowning my furies in worldly indulgances, I suppose one slice wouldn’t hurt,” the chicken uncrossed its wings and scooted closer to the table like a fat man at a buffet, flailing its twiggy legs to and fro to hop the chair towards the plate and utensils. The Hatter brandished a massive carving knife, suitable for perhaps a leg of lamb or a suckling pig, and made a surgically precise incision into the center of the cake. White syrup gushed out through the cracks of the slice and spilled over onto the tablecloth. </p>
	<p class="tab">“Ah I see it’s a leaking cake, most good for the digestion,” the chicken licked its beak and inhaled the fumes of broken crust through its nose holes. Its eyes rolled back and the Hatter paused, mid cut, slowly drawing the knife to a napkin trailing a gelatinous and intestinal string of white goo along with it. He slid the knife along the white cloth, failing entirely to clean the metal and instead covered the napkin with a mucous of white sugar. He grinned wickedly,
	“Well I know you haven’t eaten for days, and the urge to rush must be utterly overwhelming.” The chicken seized up, fighting down a frustration roiling up from, not its belly, but a more primal, urging part of its brain. The part that saws kill him now and eat the cake. </p>
	<p class="tab">“I don't quite know what you mean,” it turned away, keeping the cake just in sight, watching the Hatter poised with a plate and the enslimed napkin. The Hatter lifted the cake from the plate, dripping white, and slapped it onto the plate. The chicken swallowed. 
	“Well, then I’m sure you wouldn’t mind if we walked another bound around Wonderland and then ate,” he smirked and furiously smashed the plate onto the table, cake down. It collapsed under the porcelain and oozed out onto the table. “And now it’s gone and ruined my finery, I’ll have to clean that up.” The Hatter picked up a water jug like a toddler grabbed at a sippy cup and doused the entire cake and the squashed piece. Soggy crumbs ran all over the floor and through the drains positioned conveniently at each table leg. The chicken let out a strangled gasp and felt rage licking up from its stomach. 
	“What you monster?” It shrieked, flapping its wings and producing a cloud of feathers and dandruff.
	“Now now, calm your cravings, we wouldn’t want you to lose control, now would we? </p><p class="tab">There’s only enough room for one kind of insanity here.” The Hatter smiled furiously, baring all forty-four teeth and the red veins near the backs of his eyes.</p>
	<p> </p>

The Automaton
	<p class="tab">Well, I suppose now is as good a time as any to start. </p>
<p class="tab">The advantage of being an automaton is that I never run out of steam. My enthusiasm never flags, my productivity never dips, and my motivation never wavers. The problem is that I cannot wind myself up. So I sit, collecting dust and dead fruit flies until some pair of little (or, preferably, world-worn and caring) hands scoops me up in a cloud of debris and winds the key at the small of my back. </p>
<p class="tab">Then I spring to life. My gears begin to turn, my joints creak and plead for oil, my eyes flicker open (not that I can see, in the human sense), and my posture straightens out like a schoolboy stung by a wasp. I snap both hands together and lift the pen that has (presumably) been placed between my left forefinger and thumb. Then I draw. I draw whatever pops into my mind; valleys, mountains, houses, television remotes, novelty porcelain salt shakers that look like squirrels, armchairs, bags of potatoes, those funny poodle-curl carpet wigs that members of Parliament still wear despite the fact that it’s 2055. It all flows out, and the winder watches spellbound, mouth agog, usually pointing and attempting to utter some adequate expression of wonder and awe. </p>
<p class="tab">I simply keep drawing. Then as more gather around the table where I sit, industrious and furiously scribbling, I notice the lines coming more slowly, the ink beginning to blot in frustratingly irregular patterns, the paper occasionally crinkling up like it smelled something bad. And then I stop. I don’t know how or when exactly it happens, but just at some moment I know I am still, and I had previously been moving. At this point a sigh of contentment usually rises, and I’m put back onto the shelf, wrapped in my smothering cocoon of metal and dead insects, waiting.</p>
